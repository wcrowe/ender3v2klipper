All of these companies have played a role in the pandemic.
I find some extremely alarming in that they appear to have benefited GREATLY from it over the course of the last year and a half.
ALL of these corporations should be investigated for conflict of interest. 
Does the CDC have a board of non-affiliated citizens to audit their funding? 
Where is the oversight? 
Is it an internal committee?
That in and of itself is a conflict of interest.
